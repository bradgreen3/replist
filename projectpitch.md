# RepList

### Pitch

RepList is an application for classical musicians to create and share lists of
repertoire they've performed

### Problem

Classical musicians do not currently have a centralized repository for
repertoire lists and audio/video recordings. Students applying for college
music programs submit a plain text document of repertoire performed and
recordings of their playing separately. This is messy and more work than
necessary.

### Solution

RepList allows users to create, edit and share their repertoire lists. By
using the SoundCloud API, a user is able to upload audio performances to their
repertoire list. With RepList, plain text repertoire lists and disorganized
performance recordings are a thing of the past.  


### Target Audience

Classical musicians of all ages, but will primarily be used by high school and
collegiate musicians.

### Integrations

* Which APIs will you use?
  * SoundCloud, scalable to also use YouTube
* Which OAuth integration are you planning to use?
  * 2.0
